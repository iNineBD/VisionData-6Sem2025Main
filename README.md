## üéØ About...
> In any organization, the search for efficiency and cost reduction is constant. At Pro4tech, we have identified a valuable opportunity in a large volume of old support ticket data that, being disorganized, is not being leveraged. This lack of structure results in a cycle of inefficiency: the team wastes time searching for solutions to problems that have already been resolved, and the company fails to extract strategic insights from a rich history of information.

> There is a need to transform this "stagnant knowledge" into an accessible and functional asset. It is fundamental to have an intelligent database that not only streamlines the daily work of employees but also provides a clear and predictive vision for leadership.


## üí° Solution
> Our mission is to unlock this hidden value. We propose the creation of an intelligent system that will transform raw and unstructured ticket data into an organized and easily searchable knowledge base. This solution will allow employees to quickly find resolutions for recurring problems, optimizing the time spent and speeding up service.

> In addition to functioning as a query tool, the application will go further, using data intelligence to generate strategic metrics and insights. This will enable management to visualize trends, anticipate problems, and make decisions based on concrete data, driving operational efficiency, process optimization, and consequently, Pro4tech's business results.
